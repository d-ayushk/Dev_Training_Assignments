1. Explain difference in flow control js and other language like python, c with example code.
The difference is that js is non-blocking single threaded and event loop based language while
other languages are multithreading by default and blocking languages.
Other main difference is that the way they handle class and objects are very different
in js everyfunciton is a consturctor function to a <function>.prototype object and other objects
can inherit from the <function>.prototype object by creating a object of that function using 
new <function>.
