1. Explain difference b/w callback, promise and async await with example code.

Callback :
    Callback is a funciton given to another function as a prameter ,so that it can be called 
    after execution of that funciton.
    Callback funciton has 2 prameter one is error and then is the actual result that has to be
    given from the executing function, if a error is found during execution of the function then
    that error is given as a prameter to the callback function.
    Mainly used to make the code behave in a synchronous way.

    e.g:

        let report = (res)=>{
            alert("The sum is:",res);
        }

        funciton sum(a,b,report){
            let sm = a+b;
            report(sm);
        }
        sum(1,3);




Promise : 
    A Promise is a piece of code that runs a code and returns the result of the code in the from
    of resolve or reject it means that if the code runs properly it returns resolve otherwise returns
    reject. This is then caught by either .then or .catch block which is run using different queue 
    in libuv and the other things execute asynchronously. There is also a .finally block that 
    executes regardless of the result.

    some other features of promises are that they can be chained and the result can be passed down 
    there can be multiple catchs et cetera.

    A Promise is something that is used to make callbacks more readable, If we have many callbacks
    one after another ,id est nested callbacks , the readability of the code reduces by a lot 
    hece promise 

    e.g:
        funciton sum(a,b){
            return new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
                let res= a+b;
                resolve(res);
            });
        }

        sum(1,2).then((res)=>alert("The sum is:",res));

async await:
    Async is a keyword in js to make a code asynchronous which allows us to use await.
    using Async does not make a funciton run asynchronously we need to use await to do that.
    Async always results in a promise.even if the returned value is not a promise it is wrapped
    in a promise.
    Await requres a thenable object and blocks the function to do that task and this task in done
    by the queues of libuv and other things outside the funciton continue their execution.
    This removes the need to use a .then format or callback format and makes the code much more
    readable.

    e.g:
        async function add(a, b) {
            let ans = await Promise.resolve(
            setTimeout(() => a + b),
            1000
        );
        console.log(`The sum is:${ans}`);
        return ans;
        }

        add(1, 2).then((sum)=>alert(`I got sum outside:${sum}`));
