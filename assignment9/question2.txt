2. Explain difference ways in which child process can be created and difference b/w them.

spawn
Creates a child process for heavy tasks.
Data flows between parent and child in raw streams (manual formatting required).
Provides events for the parent to listen to:
stdout.on("data"), stderr.on("data"), on("error"), on("close"), on("exit").

exec
Used to execute binaries or shell commands.
Buffers the entire output and then returns it as a string.
Parent receives events: error, close, exit.

execFile
Similar to exec, but executes a specific file directly without using a shell.
Safer and faster when you know the exact executable.
Events are the same as exec: error, close, exit.

fork
A special version of spawn for creating Node.js subprocesses only.
Supports built-in structured messaging between parent and child using message and disconnect events.
Events: message, disconnect, error, exit, close, stdout("data"), stderr("data").
